# Introduction: YPLL

Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) is widely used for measuring the rate and distribution of premature mortality. [CHRR](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/county-health-rankings-model/health-outcomes/length-of-life/premature-death?year=2023) uses YPLL as one of health outcomes to measure county health status.YPLL is a rate and age-adjusted, and it can be calculated as

$$
\boxed{ {YPLL \: Rate }_{{age-adj}}=\sum_{i=0}^{75} \frac {(75-i)\cdot d_i\cdot  {w_i}}{p_i} \cdot 100,000}
$$
where 

*   $75$ is the upper age limit established, 
    
*   $i$ is the midpoint of the grouped year of age at death (e.g., 59.5 for age group 55-64),
    
*   $d_i$ is the number of deaths at age $i$.
  
*   $p_i$ is the population for age group i. 

*   $\sum p_i$ is the population between the lower and upper age limits (e.g., 75 as the upper age limit and 0 as the lower age limit)

*   ${w_i}$ is the weight of age adjustment for group i on the basis of the US standard year 2000 population. $\sum w_i = 1$

The population data is needed in the denominator of the above formula, and $p_i$ has been based on the single-year-of-age, bridged-race, county-level population estimates released by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The series of bridged-race population estimates is a collaborative work between NCHS and U. S. Census Bureau. However, NCHS discontinued the production of single-year-of-age, bridged-race population estimates after releasing 2020 data. In their [documentation](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/bridged_race/Documentation-Bridged-PostcenV2020.pdf), it is mentioned that "The U.S. Census Bureau annually releases unbridged population estimates for five-year age groups and race at the county level." This post uses R to explore the feasibility of getting population data needed for subgroup YPLL calculations from Census population estimates. 

# What population data is needed for subgroup YPLL calculation

We want to have subgroup population data by age categories at county level.

## Age categories (age_cat)

From the lower age limit 0 to the upper age limit 75, the population is usually grouped into 8 age categories (coded from 0 to 7):

------

```{r}
tibble::tribble(
     ~'Age      ', ~'age_cat                  ',
      "0",       0L,
   "1-14",       1L,
  "15-24",       2L,
  "25-34",       3L,
  "35-44",       4L,
  "45-54",       5L,
  "55-64",       6L,
  "65-74",       7L
  ) |> 
  # kbl(title = "Age categories") |> 
  # kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
  print_kbl(title = "Age categories", f_width = T) |> 
  column_spec(1, width = "12em")

```

## Race/ethnicity subgroups 

Five race/ethnicity subgroups have been used in YPLL calculations at CHRR. 

```{r}
tibble::tribble(
  ~'Subgroup         ', ~Description,
  '1',       'non-Hispanic, White alone',
  '2',       'non-Hispanic, Black alone',
  '3',       'non-Hispanic, AIAN (American Indian or Alaska Native) alone',
  '4',       'non-Hispanic, Asian alone',
  '8',       'Hispanic'
  ) |> 
print_kbl(title = "Subgroups", f_width = T)
```

**Note**: Bridged and un-bridged race populations are not identical. By bridging, those in the group "two or more races" are assigned using probabilistic factors and included in White, Black, AIAN, or Asian.

# Census population estimates

Let's use 2020 Census county-level population estimates as an example and see how the data look like. Here is the [link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2020/counties/asrh/) and the file name is `CC-EST2020-ALLDATA.csv`.

## Get data directly from Census pft website

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cc_est2020_all <- read_csv("https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2020/counties/asrh/CC-EST2020-ALLDATA.csv") |>  
  janitor::clean_names() |>  
  glimpse()
```

## Overview of the raw data

There are 776321 rows and 80 columns in the downloaded dataframe. The file layout is available [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2020/cc-est2020-alldata.pdf).

Here are the columns that we will need to have a dataset with necessary age-categories and subgroups for YPLL calculation.

-   `state`: state FIPS code

-   `county`: county FIPS code

-   `year`: Year of data

      The key for YEAR is as follows:
      
      *   1 = 4/1/2010 Census population
      
      *   2 = 4/1/2010 population estimates base
      
      *   3 = 7/1/2010 population estimate
      
      *   4 = 7/1/2011 population estimate
      
      *   5 = 7/1/2012 population estimate
      
      *   6 = 7/1/2013 population estimate
      
      *   7 = 7/1/2014 population estimate
      
      *   8 = 7/1/2015 population estimate
      
      *   9 = 7/1/2016 population estimate
      
      *   10 = 7/1/2017 population estimate
      
      *   11 = 7/1/2018 population estimate
      
      *   12 = 7/1/2019 population estimate
      
      *   13 = 7/1/2020 population estimate

We will subset the original data with `year == 13` to get 2020 population estimate. 

-   `agegrp`: Age group

      0 = Total
      
      1 = Age 0 to 4 years
      
      2 = Age 5 to 9 years
      
      3 = Age 10 to 14 years
      
      4 = Age 15 to 19 years
      
      5 = Age 20 to 24 years
      
      6 = Age 25 to 29 years
      
      7 = Age 30 to 34 years
      
      8 = Age 35 to 39 years
      
      9 = Age 40 to 44 years
      
      10 = Age 45 to 49 years
      
      11 = Age 50 to 54 years
      
      12 = Age 55 to 59 years
      
      13 = Age 60 to 64 years
      
      14 = Age 65 to 69 years
      
      15 = Age 70 to 74 years
      
      16 = Age 75 to 79 years
      
      17 = Age 80 to 84 years
      
      18 = Age 85 years or older
      
We need `agegrp` from 1 to 15 to create age categories shown in Table 1. One **challenge** is how we can get infant population (age_cat = 0) from a dataset with 5-year age groups. One way is to approximate the infant population by taking 20% of population in `agegrp = 1` (age 0 to 4 years), assuming the data has a uniform distribution within this age group. This approach is not ideal, but it may be a realistic option for most counties. A possible better way to have infant population is to use births data for each county, which is out of the scope for this post.     

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Construct age categories for YPLL calculation", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("age_groups.png")
```

-   columns for race/ethnicity groups

Table 3 shows the columns in the raw data that we need to create the subgroups in Table 2.

## County population by age categories and race/ethnicity subgroups

### age_cat = 2-7
```{r echo=TRUE}

### age_cat = 0: infant population

Take 1/5 of population in agegrp = 1
```{r echo=TRUE}

```

### age_cat = 1: 1-14 year
```{r echo=TRUE}
# age_cat = 1: 1-14
cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_1 <- cc_2020_agegrp_sig_r |>

cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_1 |> head(5)
```

### all age categories

```{r echo=TRUE}
cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_0_7 <- bind_rows(
  cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_0,
  cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_1,
  cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_2_7) |>
  arrange(statecode, countycode, age_cat) |>  
  # round numbers
  mutate(across(c(4:8), ~round(.)))

cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_0_7 |> 
  head(5)
```

### Pivot tabel longer so that we have one column of subgroup codes and one column for population

```{r echo=TRUE}
cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_0_7_long <- cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_0_7 |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(4:8), names_to = "race", values_to = "pop") |> 
  mutate(race = case_when(
    race == "white" ~ 1,
    race == "black" ~ 2,
    race == "aian" ~ 3,
    race == "asian" ~ 4,
    race == "hispanic" ~ 8,
    TRUE ~ NA_real_))
```

Let's take a look at the top 20 rows.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# top 20 rows
cc_2020_sg_r_agecat_0_7_long |> 
  head(50) |>

# Summary

This post shows the feasibility to create a dataset of county-level population estimates by age categories and subgroups, which might be useful for YPLL calcuations.
