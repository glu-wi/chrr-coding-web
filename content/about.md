(by Ganhua Lu @ CHRR)

This website was started in Summer 2022 as a dedicated space for documenting and sharing discussions on coding within the Data & Analytics (D&A) and Population Health Research (PHR) teams at [CHRR](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/), a program of the [University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute](https://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/). Initially, it served as a repository for our team's coding conversations and collaborative efforts.

As time went on, I began to post content related to various data analytics tasks I undertook at CHRR. These posts have been instrumental in helping me keep track of my learning journey and consolidate insights that could be beneficial to other data analysts. By sharing my experiences and solutions, I aim to contribute to the broader data analytics community.

In my data exploration and analysis, I primarily use R, SAS, and Python. Each tool brings its unique strengths to the table, allowing me to approach data from different angles and achieve comprehensive results. I am particularly interested in data visualization, data wrangling, and statistical modeling, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills in these areas.

The website was made using R `blogdown` package.
