This website was built in Summer 2022 as a place for recording the discussions on coding within D&A and PHR teams at CHRR. Afterwards, I started posting things related to some data analytics tasks I did at CHRR. Making these posts helps me keep notes of my learning and summarize what I think might be useful for other data analysts at CHRR. I explore data mostly using R and SAS, and sometimes using Python. - GL   

The website was made using R `blogdown` package.
