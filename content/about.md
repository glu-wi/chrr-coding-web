This website was started in Summer 2022 as a place for recording the discussions on coding within D&A and PHR teams at [CHRR](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/), a program of the [University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute](https://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/). Afterwards, I started posting things related to some data analytics tasks I did at CHRR. Making these posts has helped me keep notes of my learning and summarize what I think might be useful for other data analysts. 

I explore data mostly using R and SAS, and sometimes using Python.  

The website was made using R `blogdown` package.
